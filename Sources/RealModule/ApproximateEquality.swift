  /// Mathematical Properties:
  /// ------------------------
  /// 
  /// - `isApproximatelyEqual(to:relativeTolerance:norm:)` is _reflexive_ for
  ///   non-exceptional values (such as NaN).
  ///
  /// - `isApproximatelyEqual(to:relativeTolerance:norm:)` is _symmetric_.
  ///
  /// - `isApproximatelyEqual(to:relativeTolerance:norm:)` is __not__ _transitive_.
  ///   Because of this, approximately equality is __not an equivalence relation__,
  ///   even when restricted to non-exceptional values.
  ///
  /// - For any point `a`, the set of values that compare approximately equal to `a` is _convex_.
  ///   (Under the assumption that the `.magnitude` property implements a valid norm.)
  ///
  /// - `isApproximatelyEqual(to:relativeTolerance:norm:)` is _scale invariant_,
  ///   so long as no underflow or overflow has occured, and no exceptional value is produced
  ///   by the scaling.
  ///
  /// See Also:
  /// -------
  /// - `isApproximatelyEqual(to:absoluteTolerance:[relativeTolerance:norm:])`
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///
  ///   - other: The value to which `self` is compared.
  ///
  ///   - relativeTolerance: The tolerance to use for the comparison.
  ///     Defaults to `.ulpOfOne.squareRoot()`.
  ///
  ///     This value should be non-negative and less than or equal to 1.
  ///     This constraint on is only checked in debug builds, because a mathematically
  ///     well-defined result exists for any tolerance, even one out of range.
  ///
  ///   - norm: The [norm] to use for the comparison.
