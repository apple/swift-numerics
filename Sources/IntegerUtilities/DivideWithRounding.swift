  /// By default, this function uses ``RoundingRule/down``, which **is not
  /// the same** as the rounding of the `/` operator from the Swift standard
  /// library. They agree when the signs of the arguments match, but produce
  /// different results when the quotient is negative. This behavior is
  /// chosen because it generally produces a more useful remainder; in
  /// particular, when the divisor is positive, the remainder is always
  /// positive. To match the behavior of `/`, use ``RoundingRule/towardZero``.
  ///
  /// Note that the remainder of division is not always representable in an
  /// unsigned type if a rounding rule other than ``RoundingRule/down``,
  /// ``RoundingRule/towardZero``, or ``RoundingRule/requireExact`` is
  /// used. For example:
  /// ```swift
  /// let a: UInt = 5
  /// let b: UInt = 3
  /// let q = a.divided(by: b, rounding: .up) // 2
  /// let r = a - b*q // 5 - 3*2 overflows UInt.
  /// ```
  /// For this reason, there is no `remainder(dividingBy:rounding:)`
  /// operation defined on `BinaryInteger`. Signed integers do not have
  /// this problem, so the `SignedInteger` protocol is extended with
  /// ``SignedInteger/divided(by:rounding:)`` returning both quotient
  /// and remainder.
