// TODO: it's unfortunate that we can't specify a custom random source
// for the stochastic rounding rule, but I don't see a nice way to have
// that share the API with the other rounding rules, because we'd then
// have to take either the rule in-out or have an additional RNG/state
// parameter. The same problem applies to rounding with dithering and
// any other stateful rounding method. We should consider adding a
// stateful rounding API down the road to support those use cases.

/// A rule that defines how to select one of the two representable results
/// closest to a given value.

/// [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Rounding_to_integer)

  /// results in aggregate. For a contrived but illustrative example, consider
  /// the following:
  /// ```
  /// let data = Array(repeating: 1, count: 100)
  /// let result = data.reduce(0) {
  ///   $0 + $1.divided(by: 3, rounding: rule)
  /// }
  /// ```

  /// deterministic rounding rule must produce either 0 or 100 for
  /// this computation. But rounding `stochastically` will
  /// produce a value close to 33. The _error_ of the computation
  /// is smaller, but the result will now change between runs of the
  /// program.
  ///
  /// For this simple case a better solution would be to add the
  /// values first, and then divide. This gives a result that is both
  /// reproducible _and_ accurate:
  /// ```
  /// let result = data.reduce(0, +)/3
  /// ```
  /// but this isn't always possible in more sophisticated scenarios,
  /// and in those cases this rounding rule may be useful.
  ///
  /// Examples:
  /// - `(-4).divided(by: 3, rounding: .stochastically)`
  /// will be –1 with probability 2/3 and –2 with probability 1/3.
  /// - `5.shifted(rightBy: 1, rounding: .stochastically)`
  /// will be 2 with probability 1/2 and 3 with probability 1/2.
  case stochastically
  
  /// If the value being rounded is representable, that value is returned.
  /// Otherwise, a precondition failure occurs.
  ///
  /// Examples:
  /// - `(-4).divided(by: 3, rounding: .requireExact)` will trap,
  /// because –4/3 = –1.3̅ is not an integer.
