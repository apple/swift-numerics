  ///
  /// Some examples of different rounding rules:
  ///
  ///     // 3/2 is 1.5, which rounds (down by default) to 1.
  ///     3.shifted(rightBy: 1)
  ///
  ///     // 1.5 rounds up to 2.
  ///     3.shifted(rightBy: 1, rounding: .up)
  ///
  ///     // The two closest values are 1 and 2, 1 is returned because it
  ///     // is odd.
  ///     3.shifted(rightBy: 1, rounding: .toOdd)
  ///
  ///     // 7/2^2 = 1.75, so the result is 1 with probability 1/4, and 2
  ///     // with probability 3/4.
  ///     7.shifted(rightBy: 2, rounding: .stochastically)
  ///
  ///     // 4/2^2 = 4/4 = 1, exactly.
  ///     4.shifted(rightBy: 2, rounding: .trap)
  ///
  ///     // 5/2 is 2.5, which is not exact, so this traps.
  ///     5.shifted(rightBy: 1, rounding: .requireExact)
  ///
  /// When `Self(1) << count` is positive, the following are equivalent:

  ///     a.shifted(rightBy: count, rounding: rule)
  ///     a.divided(by: 1 << count, rounding: rule)

      // That pathological case taken care of, we can now handle over-wide
      // shifts by first shifting all but bitWidth - 1 bits with sticky
      // rounding, and then shifting the remaining bitWidth - 1 bits with
      // the desired rounding mode.

    }
    // Now we are in the happy case: 0 < count < bitWidth, which makes all
    // the math to handle rounding simpler.
    //
    // TODO: If we were really, really careful about overflow, some of these
    // could be made simpler. E.g. mathematically round up is implemented here
    // via:
    //
    //   floor = self >> count
    //   mask = 1 << count - 1
    //   lost = self & mask
    //   return floor + (lost == 0 ? 0 : 1)
    //
    // _if_ we didn't have to worry about intermediate overflow (either because
    // self is bounded away from .max or because we don't have a fixed-width
    // type), then we could use the following instead:
    //
    //   mask = 1 << count - 1
    //   return (self + mask) >> count
    //
    // However, self + mask can overflow, e.g. if we're shifting .max by 1:
    //
    //   mask = 1 << 1 - 1 = 1
    //   self + mask = .max + 1 // uh-oh
    //
    // This cannot occur for arbitrary-precision numbers, so we could use
    // the simpler expressions for those (but those are precisely the cases
    // where performance of rounding does not matter much, because shifts
    // get swamped by even basic arithmetic). More interesting, we could
    // promote fixed-width numbers to a wider type, preventing this
    // intermediate overflow and allowing us to use the simpler expressions
    // much of the time. We could also explicitly _detect_ the overflow if
    // it happens and patch up the result, though this is a little bit tricky
    // because addingReportingOverflow and friends do not exist on
    // BinaryInteger. Hence, this is a TODO for the future.
