# Complex Numbers

```swift
 1> import Complex
 2> let z = Complex(1,1) // z = 1 + i
```

Complex numbers, generic over an underlying real type.

### A note about mixed real-complex arithmetic.
It is tempting to define real-complex arithmetic operators, because we use them as
shorthand all the time in mathematics: `z + x` or `2w`. For now, we have not provided
them in this module for two reasons:
- Swift generally avoids heterogenous arithmetic operators
- They lead to counter-intuitive behavior of type inference.
For a concrete example of the second point, suppose that heterogeneous arithmetic
operators existed, and consider the following snippet:
```swift
let a: RealType = 1
let b = 2*a
```
what is the type of `b`?

If there is no type context, `b` is ambiguous; `2*a` could be interpreted as
`Complex(2)*a` or as `RealType(2)*a`. That's fairly annoying on its own. However,
suppose that we're in a `Complex` type context:
```swift
extension Complex {
  static func doSomething() {
    let a: RealType = 1
    let b = 2*a // type is inferred as Complex ðŸ¤ª
  }
}
```
This is a show-stopper for heterogeneous arithmetic operators in the short term.

### A note about infinity and nan
C and C++ attempt to define precise semantics that interpret the sign of infinity and zero.
This is occasionally useful, but it also results in a lot of extra work. The swift-numerics
`Complex` type does not assign any semantic meaning to the sign of zero and infinity;
`(Â±0,Â±0)`, are all considered to be encodings of the value zero. Similarly, `(Â±inf, y)`,
`(x, Â±inf)`, `(nan, y)` and `(x, nan)` are all considered to be encodings of a single
exceptional value with infinite magnitude and undefined phase.

Because the phase is undefined, the `.real` and `.imag` properties return `.nan` 

We will revisit this decision once user gain some experience working with the type to
make sure that it's a tradeoff that we're happy with, but early experiments show that
it greatly simplifies the implementation of some operations without significant tradeoffs
in usability.
