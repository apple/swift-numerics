// Policy: deliberately not using the * and / operators for these at the
// moment, because then there's an ambiguity in expressions like 2*z; is
// that Complex(2) * z or is it RealType(2) * z? This is especially
// problematic in type inference: suppose we have:
//
//   let a: RealType = 1
//   let b = 2*a
//
// what is the type of b? If we don't have a type context, it's ambiguous.
// If we have a Complex type context, then b will be inferred to have type
// Complex! Obviously, that doesn't help anyone.
