// Implementation goals, in order of priority:
//
// 1. Get the branch cuts right. We should match Kahan's /Much Ado/
//    paper for finite values.
// 2. Have good relative accuracy in the complex norm.
// 3. Preserve sign symmetries where possible.
// 4. Handle the point at infinity consistently with basic operations.
//    This means diverging from what C and C++ do for non-finite inputs.
// 5. Get good componentwise accuracy /when possible/. I don't know how
//    to do that for all of these functions off the top of my head, and
//    I don't think that other libraries have tried to do so in general,
//    so this is a research project. We should not sacrifice 1-4 for it.
//    Note that multiplication and division don't even provide good
//    componentwise relative accuracy, so it's _totally OK_ to not get
//    it for these functions too. But: it's a dynamite long-term research
//    project.
// 6. Give the best performance we can. We should care about performance,
//    but with lower precedence than the other considerations.
//
// Except where derivations are given, the expressions used here are all
// adapted from Kahan's 1986 paper "Branch Cuts for Complex Elementary
// Functions; or: Much Ado About Nothing's Sign Bit".

    // lurking here:
    //
    //   - length can overflow even when log(z) is finite.
    //
    //   - when length is close to 1, catastrophic cancellation is hidden
    //     in this expression. Consider, e.g. z = 1 + δi for small δ.
    //
    //     Because δ ≪ 1, |z| rounds to 1, and so log |z| produces zero.
    //     We can expand using Taylor series to see that the result should
    //     be:
    //
    //         log |z| = log √(1 + δ²)
    //                 = log(1 + δ²)/2
    //                 = δ²/2 + O(δ⁴)
    //
    //     So naively using log |z| results in a total loss of relative
    //     accuracy for this case. Note that this is _not_ constrained near
    //     a single point; it occurs everywhere close to the circle |z| = 1.
    //
    //     Note that this case still _does_ deliver a result with acceptable
    //     relative accuracy in the complex norm, because
    //
    //         Im(log z) ≈ δ ≫ δ²/2 ≈ Re(log z).
    //
    // There are a number of ways to try to tackle this problem. I'll begin
    // with a simple one that solves the first issue, and _sometimes_ the
    // second, then analyze when it doesn't work for the second case.
    //
    // To handle very large arguments without overflow, the standard
    // approach is to _rescale_ the problem. We can do this by finding
    // whichever of x and y has greater magnitude, and dividing through
    // by it. You can think of this as changing coordinates by reflections
    // so that we get a new value w = u + iv with |w| = |z| (and hence
    // Re(log w) = Re(log z), and 0 ≤ u, 0 ≤ v ≤ u.
    let u = max(z.x.magnitude, z.y.magnitude)
    let v = min(z.x.magnitude, z.y.magnitude)
    // Now expand out log |w|:
    //
    //     log |w| = log(u² + v²)/2
    //             = log u + log(onePlus: (v/u)²)/2
    //
    // This looks promising! It handles overflow well, because log(u) is
    // finite for every finite u, and we have 0 ≤ v/u ≤ 1, so the second
    // term is bounded by 0 ≤ log(1 + (v/u)²)/2 ≤ (log 2)/2. It also
    // handles the example I gave above well: we have u = 1, v = δ, and
    //
    //     log(1) + log(onePlus: δ²)/2 = 0 + δ²/2
    //
    // as expected.
    //
    // Unfortunately, it does not handle all points close to the unit
    // circle so well; it's easy to see why if we look at the two terms
    // that contribute to the result. Cancellation occurs when the result
    // is close to zero and the terms have opposing signs. By construction,
    // the second term is always positive, so the easiest observation is
    // that cancellation is only a problem for u < 1 (because otherwise
    // log u is also positive, and there can be no cancellation).
    //
    // We are not trying for sub-ulp accuracy, just a good relative error
    // bound, so for our purposes it suffices to have log u dominate the
    // result:
    if u >= 1 || u >= RealType._mulAdd(u,u,v*v) {

    // Here we're in the tricky case; cancellation is likely to occur.
    // Instead of the factorization used above, we will want to evaluate
    // log(onePlus: u² + v² - 1)/2. This all boils down to accurately
    // evaluating u² + v² - 1. To begin, calculate both squared terms
    // as exact head-tail products (u is guaranteed to be well scaled,
    // v may underflow, but if it does it doesn't matter, the u term is
