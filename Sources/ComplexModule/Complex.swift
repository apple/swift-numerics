/// A complex number represented by real and imaginary parts.
///
/// TODO: introductory text on complex numbers
///
/// Implementation notes:
/// -
/// This type does not provide heterogeneous real/complex arithmetic,
/// not even the natural vector-space operations like real * complex.
/// There are two reasons for this choice: first, Swift broadly avoids
/// mixed-type arithmetic when the operation can be adequately expressed
/// by a conversion and homogeneous arithmetic. Second, with the current
/// typechecker rules, it would lead to undesirable ambiguity in common
/// expressions (see README.md for more details).
///
/// Unlike C's `_Complex` and C++'s `std::complex<>` types, we do not
/// attempt to make meaningful semantic distinctions between different
/// representations of infinity or NaN. Any Complex value with at least
/// one non-finite component is simply "non-finite". In as much as
/// possible, we use the semantics of the point at infinity on the
/// Riemann sphere for such values. This approach simplifies the number of
/// edge cases that need to be considered for multiplication, division, and
/// the elementary functions considerably.
///
/// `.magnitude` does not return the Euclidean norm; it uses the "infinity
/// norm" (`max(|real|,|imaginary|)`) instead. There are two reasons for this
/// choice: first, it's simply faster to compute on most hardware. Second,
/// there exist values for which the Euclidean norm cannot be represented
/// (consider a number with `.real` and `.imaginary` both equal to
/// `RealType.greatestFiniteMagnitude`; the Euclidean norm would be
/// `.sqrt(2) * .greatestFiniteMagnitude`, which overflows). Using
/// the infinity norm avoids this problem entirely without significant
/// downsides. You can access the Euclidean norm using the `length`
/// property.
